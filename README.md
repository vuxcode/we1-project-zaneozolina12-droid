# Project Summary

This project is a website for a company called MP Power Bygg.

The website is made with HTML and CSS.
There is no JavaScript.

The website has these pages:
- Home
- Services (English and Swedish)
- Gallery
- Contact (English and Swedish)

The website works on computer and mobile phone.
I used simple responsive design. To keep it structured and uncomplicated 

The gallery has buttons for:
- Stairs
- Kitchen
- Roofs
- Other

Each button opens its own gallery page where all the pictures are sorted and cleand up nicley. 

I used Git and GitHub to save and publish my project.
